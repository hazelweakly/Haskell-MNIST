# MNIST

A neural network originally designed for a class assignment.
Don't worry, it's super brokenâ„¢ (check out the absurd timings in the results).
The code is still a bit rough around the edges (and broken!); I haven't touched it in over a year...

Heavily inspired by Justin Le's awesome article about [dependently typed neural networks in Haskell](https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html).
